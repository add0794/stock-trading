# stock-trading

It can be *very* time-consuming to follow a company's stock value, but you still want to earn a little extra income from investing in your favorite public company.

No more!

This program not only tracks changes in its stock value, but automatically texts you when a significant change happens (e.g. 5%). When you set the percentage change, JSON files are created for each day for the last few months:

1. Open
2. High
3. Low
4. Close
5. Volume

Articles are generated in a separate JSON file that brings up when the company's name is discussed and on which date.

Make your investing life easier, and perhaps, stop using a certified financial analyst (CFA) to do the dirty work.
